Renewable Energy Engineering Guide PWA is ready. Here's what's included:
12 Modules covering the full curriculum — Solar PV (cell physics, array design, string sizing), Wind (Betz limit, DFIG vs PMSG, pitch control), Hydro, Power Electronics (MPPT algorithms with P&O and Incremental Conductance detail), Transformers (equivalent circuit, Dyn11 explained, inrush), Grid Synchronization (SRF-PLL block diagram, IEEE 1547 relay settings), SCADA Integration (Modbus RTU frame structure, register map, IEC 61850), Monitoring (PR/CUF formulas, loss categories), Fault Analysis (symmetrical components, IDMT grading), a complete 5 MW+2 MW Hybrid Case Study, and interactive Commissioning Checklists.
Interactive features:
4 engineering calculators (PV sizing, wind power with altitude correction, transformer turns ratio, Modbus poll cycle estimator)
Live SCADA log simulator with level filtering and real event messages
Expandable accordion lessons with inline quizzes
Tap-to-check commissioning checklists (DC, inverter, AC/protection)
Full SCADA architecture diagram with protocol reference tables and Modbus register map
PWA features: Service worker for offline caching, installable manifest, dark/light mode toggle, WCAG AAA contrast, 44px minimum tap targets, 8px grid spacing, custom select arrows, nav active state with top border glow + icon background highlight.
What it does well:
Real engineering content (SRF-PLL math, Modbus framing, IDMT curves, Dyn11 explanation)
Structured modules with expandable lessons
Interactive quizzes with feedback
Working calculators with correct formulas
SCADA log simulation
